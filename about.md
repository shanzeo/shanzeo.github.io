![TeXt Theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme/master/screenshots/TeXt-home.jpg)

Hello there! My name is Shanze Owais, and I am a passionate and dedicated data science major with a deep interest in uncovering insights through data. Currently, I am pursuing my degree at Michigan State University. Throughout my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in statistical analysis and data visualization. My academic journey has equipped me with proficiency in tools and languages such as Python, Java, SQL, NumPy, and Seaborn, allowing me to tackle complex data-driven challenges. 

I thrive on solving challenging problems and have worked on diverse projects that demonstrate my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios. From predicting the spread of COVID-19 to analyzing climate change patterns, my work is driven by a commitment to accuracy, impact, and positive change. 

Beyond my technical skills, I am an effective communicator and a collaborative team player. I am eager to connect with fellow data enthusiasts and explore opportunities that challenge me to grow and make meaningful contributions to the field of data science.
