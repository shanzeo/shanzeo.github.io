In this project, I tackled wildfire simulation using Java. My goal was to model the spread of wildfires across a simulated landscape. I built a two-dimensional grid representing the forest, with each cell containing information like tree density and burning state. Java classes even allowed me to model different tree types with varying flammability. To mimic the unpredictable nature of wildfires, the simulation incorporated factors like wind direction and intensity, along with probabilistic rules that determined how neighboring trees caught fire based on proximity and prevailing wind. While visualization was optional, the project could be extended to include an animation showcasing the fire's progression across the landscape using libraries like JavaFX.  This project wasn't just about creating a simulation; it offered valuable insights into wildfire dynamics and spread patterns. It allowed me to experiment with different scenarios and understand factors influencing fire behavior. Ultimately, this Java wildfire simulator could be a valuable tool for wildfire education and preparedness efforts.
