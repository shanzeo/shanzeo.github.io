In this project, I explored the spread of COVID-19 using Python's capabilities. I built a simulation modeling how the virus propagates within a population, considering factors like infection rates, recovery times, and social distancing measures. NumPy libraries ensured accurate calculations within the simulation. To effectively communicate the results, I utilized Matplotlib or Seaborn to create compelling visualizations. These visualizations depicted the spread over time, highlighting how social distancing impacts the infection curve. Heatmaps even showcased the spatial distribution of cases within the simulated population. This project offered valuable insights into the factors influencing COVID-19 spread. It allowed me to experiment with different mitigation strategies in a safe, virtual environment, while the visualizations effectively communicated the impact of public health measures.
