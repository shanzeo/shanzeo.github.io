In this Python project, I tackled climate change by creating informative visualizations from publicly available data. I leveraged NASA's GISTEMP dataset for global temperatures. Python libraries like Pandas helped clean and analyze the data, while Matplotlib or Seaborn brought it to life with visualizations. These visualizations included time series graphs showcasing the rise in global temperatures, and heatmaps depicting temperature variations across the globe. I even created comparisons between specific regions. To make things even more impactful, I introduced interactive elements using Bokeh, allowing users to explore the data themselves. This project successfully translated complex climate data into clear and compelling visuals, fostering a deeper understanding of climate change and its urgency.
